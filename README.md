# HTML Entitize [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tomcardoso/atom-html-entitize.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tomcardoso/atom-html-entitize)

This is a fork of [HTML Entities](https://github.com/AbeEstrada/atom-html-entities) using the `he` library for encoding and decoding HTML entities.

If you want to add a shortcut, just add this to your `keymap.cson`:

```
'atom-text-editor':
  'key1': 'html-entitize:encode'
  'key2': 'html-entitize:decode'
```
